## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Off-white (#F2F0F1), slightly desaturated, provides a gentle contrast that reduces eye strain during prolonged reading, fitting with the app's emphasis on writing and education. Choosing such color ensures a soft, comfortable visual experience for users.
- Accent color: Light blue (#5595c9) – An analogous color that stands out from the primary hue due to higher brightness and saturation, drawing user attention and adding depth to the site’s minimalistic aesthetic.
- Serif fonts like Lora or Georgia for body text, enhancing readability.
- Sans-serif fonts for headings, providing a modern contrast.
- Generous spacing between text elements to improve reading flow and comprehension.
- Responsive design ensuring the website is fully functional and visually appealing on various devices.
- Use a consistent set of icons related to writing, reading, and community.
